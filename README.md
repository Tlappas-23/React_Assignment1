# Bootstrap Registration Webpage

## Project Overview

This project is a simple responsive webpage built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  
It demonstrates how to use Bootstrap components to create a form, table, images, buttons, and a navigation bar that work well on different screen sizes.

The page is designed for learning purposes and does not store real user data.

## Files Included

### index.html
This is the main webpage file.  
It contains all the page structure and Bootstrap components, including the navigation bar, registration form, table, images, and buttons.

### styles.css
This file contains a small amount of custom styling to improve the appearance of the page, such as background color and image borders.

## Page Structure

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar appears at the top of the page with links for Home, About, and Contact.  
On smaller screens, it collapses into a menu button that opens when clicked.

### Image Section
The page includes a large banner image that stretches across the screen and adjusts to different screen sizes.  
Below the banner is a circular image styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

### Registration Form
The registration form allows users to enter:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Password
- Agreement to terms and conditions

The First Name and Last Name fields appear side by side on medium and larger screens.  
The Email and Password fields are required and must be filled out before submitting the form.  
The submit button uses Bootstrap's green success style.

### User Data Table
Below the form is a table that displays sample user data.  
The data is hard coded to simulate form submissions.  
The table includes striped rows and hover effects for better readability.  
It is responsive and scrolls horizontally on smaller screens.

### Buttons Section
The page includes two buttons:
- One button is always visible on all screen sizes.
- The second button is hidden on small screens and appears on medium and larger screens.

## Responsiveness

Bootstrap containers, grid layout, and utility classes are used to ensure the page works well on phones, tablets, and desktop screens.

## How to Use

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Resize the browser window to see how the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## Notes

This project is for practice and demonstration only.  
The form does not submit or store real data.  
All user data in the table is sample content.
